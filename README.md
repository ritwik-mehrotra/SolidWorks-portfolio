My SolidWorks models and projects


This collection of SolidWorks projects demonstrates my hands-on experience with 3D modeling, mechanical assemblies, and motion simulation. Each mechanism reflects a specific engineering concept â€” from gear trains and piston systems to variable pulleys and complex motion transfer.

Whether you're a recruiter, mentor, or fellow engineer, I invite you to explore the folders above. All models were created independently and show my growing proficiency in mechanical design, kinematics, and CAD-based simulation.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to connect or provide feedback!
